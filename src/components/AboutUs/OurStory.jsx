                The idea for EduConnect was born out of the need for a better academic collaboration tool.
                 As students, we experienced firsthand the challenges of finding study resources, 
                 engaging with lecturers outside the classroom, and forming productive discussion groups.
                  This motivated us to develop EduConnectâ€”a platform that simplifies learning 
                  interactions and empowers students with the tools they need to succeed.
